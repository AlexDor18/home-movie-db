# Solution Strategy \{#section-solution-strategy}

The solution strategy for the Home Movie DB application is designed to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture. The key components of the strategy include:
- Webserver providing a REST API for the frontend to interact with.
- A database for persistent storage of user data, movie information, and other relevant data.
- A Single page application that consumes the REST API to provide a user-friendly interface.
- Dockerized container to make the application portable and easy to deploy.
